            Your account will remain temporarily registered until we{{#if_neq LifeSupport.RegistrationOwner "EA"}} or your distributor {{Account.Distributor.Name}} {{/if_neq}} receive a completed Medical Confirmation form which has been certified by a medical practitioner. If you don't provide us a completed form, we or your distributor {{Account.Distributor.Name}}, may de-register life support from your account. This would result in you not receiving protections that apply to customers registered for life support.<br>
            <br>    
            <b>What else you need to know</b><br>
            <br>
            It is important to note that there may be planned interruptions to your supply (e.g. we need to interrupt supply for metering purposes or your distributor {{Account.Distributor.Name}} needs to interrupt supply for maintenance purposes). If this were to occur, we or your distributor {{Account.Distributor.Name}} are required to provide you advanced notification of the interruption.
            <br><br>
            In the event of an unplanned interruption you can contact your distributor {{Account.Distributor.Name}} on {{Account.Distributor.PhoneNumber}}, or us on 1300 258 763. <br>

            <br>
            You should also ensure you have a plan in the event of any unplanned interruption to your power supply, including if your life support equipment unexpectedly stops working. In your plan, we recommend you: <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Regularly check the back-up battery of your life support equipment so it's fully charged and ready for use at all times.</li>
                <li>Have access to a telephone that doesn't require power to operate and a battery-operated radio to keep up to date with restoration of power supply during severe weather events. </li>
                <li>Make sure you have important information such as names, addresses and telephone numbers of your doctor, the nearest hospital and family and friends who can help you. </li>
                <li>Consider making an emergency plan with your doctor for extended outages and emergencies.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Please note, if you ever change energy retailers, you must advise your new retailer that you depend on life support equipment in your home or business premises.<br>
